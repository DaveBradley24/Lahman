## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs
There was one NOTE; this is expected because Lahman is a large data package:
> checking installed package size ... NOTE
    installed size is  9.0Mb
    sub-directories of 1Mb or more:
      data   8.4Mb


## Comments
This is a major release, bringing the Lahman R package up to the current 2018
version of the Lahman Database. A collection of vignettes has also been added.
